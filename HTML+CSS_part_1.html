                <ol>
                    <li> Preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. (Yep, as hot as it goes!)</li>
                    <li> In a small bowl, stir the yeast and ¬Ω tablespoon sugar into warmed water until dissolved. Let it sit until it's foamy for about 7-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li> Make sure the water is warm, but not too hot or it won't work. If the yeast doesn't foam up after 7- 10 minutes, start with a new packet.</li>
                    <li> In a large bowl, add the flour, garlic powder, salt, and remaining sugar. Now whisk to combine well. Add the activated yeast to the bowl along with the olive oil. Mix until all ingredients are well combined and form a dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a couple of tablespoons of flour.</li>
                    <li> Form the dough into a ball and place back in the bowl (*lightly dust bowl with flour before placing the dough ball in). Completely cover the bowl with a damp napkin or hand towel for 30 minutes or until dough doubles in size.</li>
                    <li> You'll need a Large Pizza Pan or cutting board ready to transfer the pizza into and out of the oven, but you won't be cooking on it. The pizza will be cooked on parchment paper only. Place a large piece of parchment paper over your work area (about the size of your pan).</li>
                    <li> Dust the paper with flour so you can spread your dough easily. Cut the dough in half using a wet knife.</li>
                    <li> This recipe makes two 10-inch pizzas and I make one pizza at a time. While one is cooking, I'll prepare the other.</li>
                    <li> Using your hands, spread dough across the parchment paper into a round pizza shape to your desired thickness. I spread the dough pretty thin because it rises while cooking. The edges should be slightly thicker to form a pillowed crust.</li>
                    <li> Season your crust by lightly brushing with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and Italian herbs. Now, spread the sauce evenly with a spoon over the pizza and top with Vegan Mozzarella.</li>
                    <li> Carefully slide the parchment paper onto your pan to transfer to the oven. Now slide the parchment paper back off your pan and directly onto the middle oven rack.</li>
                    <li> Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. The pizza cooks fast so keep an eye on it.</li>
                    <li> When it comes out of the oven, I like to sprinkle it with fresh-cut basil. Fresh thyme is nice too!</li>
